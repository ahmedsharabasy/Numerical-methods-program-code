#The inverse of a square matrix M is a matrix of the same size, N, such that M Â· N = I
#TRY IT! 
#The matrix M (in the previous example) has a nonzero determinant. Compute the inverse
#of M. Show that the matrix P = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1]] has a determinant value of zero, and
#therefore has no inverse.
